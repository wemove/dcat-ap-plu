        Fetch records of the catalog with id `collectionId`.
        The response is a document consisting of records in the catalog.
        The records included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more records are selected
        that the page size.
        Different parameters can be used to select only a
        subset of the records in the catalog.
        The `bbox` parameter matches all records in the catalog that are not associated with a location, too. The
        `datetime` parameter matches all records in the catalog that are
        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.
        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected records that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page may include information about the number of selected and
        returned records (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
